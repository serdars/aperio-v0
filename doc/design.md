* Conversation tab shows the conversations with updates title bold.
* Message / conversation notifications.
* Header shows the count of "updates" for the user. Clicking takes
  to notifications tab.
* I can start a conversation from org page
* Conversation page should be able to reply in the same page.
* Deleting final message deletes the conversation

# Milestone 3: Optimization & Bugfix
* Header should include a dropdown with organizations including the number
  of notifications in each organization.
  * Dropdown should focus on the organization when looking at something
    related to the organization
* "Join Organization" button should be visible below the groups if not a
  member of the organization.
* Private groups should display details if the current_user is a member.
* Groups links should have the count of the notifications under them.
* Conversations with notifications should be visually different from the ones
  without notifications and they should be at the top.
* In the profile page conversations should be in the historical order new to
  old.
* Users can post messages only to the conversations in groups they are member
  of.
* Users shouldn't see private group related things.
